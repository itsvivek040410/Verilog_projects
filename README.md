## ✅ Completed Project: Voting Machine

### 📌 Overview
A Verilog-based voting system that includes:
- Debounced button control                    
- Vote logging for 4 candidates
- Mode switching for voting vs. result display
- LED output to indicate status or vote count

### 🧪 Testbench
Includes a full testbench (`ts.v`) that simulates:
- Vote casting by multiple button presses
- Mode switching
- Visual output on LEDs
